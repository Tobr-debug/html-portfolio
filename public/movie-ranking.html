<hr />
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>The original and best from 1977. Forget all the Episode IV - A New Hope nonsense</p>
<h3>Three Colours Blue</h3>
<p>French cinema at its best. Interwoven tales, beautiful cinematography.</p>
<h3>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</h3>
<p>Burton at his most magnificent in the John Le Carre classic.</p>
